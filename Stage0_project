The curse of dimensionality is a major challenge in cancer research, especially when working with datasets that include many features, such as gene expression profiles. As the number of features increases relative to the number of samples, it becomes harder to find meaningful patterns, and the data can become sparse. This often leads to overfitting, where models become too complex and fit noise rather than true patterns. To address this issue, techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are employed to reduce the number of features while retaining crucial information. For instance, PCA has been used to simplify gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), aiding in the identification of distinct cancer subtypes and improving the clarity of research outcomes (Jolliffe, 2002).\

Supervised learning is crucial for developing predictive models in cancer research. This approach uses labeled data to train models, enabling them to predict outcomes for new, unseen data. For example, support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests are commonly used to classify cancer types based on gene expression profiles. An application of this is the use of SVMs to categorize breast cancer patients into prognostic groups, which helps in personalizing treatment strategies (Cortes & Vapnik, 1995).\

In contrast, unsupervised learning analyzes data without predefined labels to discover hidden patterns. Clustering techniques, such as hierarchical clustering, group similar samples based on their features. This method has been used to identify new subtypes of lung cancer by analyzing gene expression data, leading to a better understanding of tumor diversity and potential new treatment approaches (Eisen et al., 1998).\

AlphaFold is a recent advancement in AI that predicts protein structures with high accuracy. This is particularly important for cancer research because many cancer-related processes involve specific protein interactions. AlphaFold’s predictions of the BRCA2 protein structure have been instrumental in designing targeted therapies for cancers associated with BRCA2 mutations, such as breast and ovarian cancer (Jumper et al., 2021).\

Bioinformatics databases like TCGA, CCLE, and ENCODE are essential for cancer research. TCGA provides comprehensive genetic data on various cancers, facilitating the understanding of cancer mechanisms and identification of potential therapeutic targets (Tomczak et al., 2015). The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) offers data on drug responses across different cancer cell lines, which aids in discovering effective treatments (Barretina et al., 2012). RNA sequencing data reveal gene expression changes associated with cancer, leading to the identification of new biomarkers and drug targets (Wang et al., 2009). KEGG provides pathway maps that help researchers understand cancer-related biological processes and develop targeted therapies (Kanehisa & Goto, 2000). ENCODE provides detailed annotations of the human genome, which are crucial for understanding gene regulation and identifying new therapeutic targets (The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012).\
\
Protein-protein network analysis helps to elucidate how proteins interact within cells, revealing potential new drug targets. For example, analyzing interactions between proteins involved in colorectal cancer has identified new targets for treatment (Goh et al., 2007). Each of these tools and techniques plays a vital role in advancing cancer research and improving treatment options, making them invaluable for ongoing efforts in cancer therapy and understanding.\
